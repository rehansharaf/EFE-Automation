/*
 * For retrying the failure test runs automatically during the test run itself,

 * The IRetryAnalyzer interface provide methods to control retrying the test runs. 
 * Here, we will override the retry() method of IRetryAnalyzer to make sure the test 
 * runs in case of failure with specified number of retry limit.
